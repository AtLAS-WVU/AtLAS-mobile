## Bug Reports ##

Reporting bugs that you encounter while using AtLAS is a great way to help move the project forward. To report a bug in AtLAS' Android application, [create an issue](https://github.com/nathantspencer/AtLAS-mobile/issues) in this repository with the red **Bug** tag.

Be sure to include as much information as you can about the bug: build logs, specifics about the device you encountered the bug on, and steps to reproduce the problem are all invaluable in helping get the issue resolved.

## Feature Requests ##

We are always looking for creative new ways to improve the AtLAS mobile experience. If you have an idea you'd like to share with us, [create an issue](https://github.com/nathantspencer/AtLAS-mobile/issues) with the pink **Feature Request** tag and we'll get back to you as soon as possible to discuss ways to make it happen.

## Development ##

If you'd like to get involved in development, we'd love you have you! There are plenty of ways to get your feet wet.

To make a small, one-time change in the AtLAS-mobile codebase, consider forking this repository, making the change, and opening a pull request. If you'd like to go this route, feel free to do so at will. Once you open your pull request, we'll get back to you as soon as possible with feedback and work towards getting your change integrated into AtLAS.

If you're interesting in making a larger change or becoming involved more permanently with AtLAS development, consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/nathantspencer/AtLAS-mobile/issues) to discuss your plans before forking or contact me at ntspencer@mix.wvu.edu to become a contributer to the repository. We welcome contributors of all experience levels with open arms!

Thanks in advance for your volunteerism! AtLAS lives or dies by the generosity of the open-source community.
